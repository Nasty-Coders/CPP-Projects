## Projects

### Intermediate Level:

1. **Library Management System**
   - **Description**: Create a console-based application for managing a library. It should allow users to add, remove, and search for books. You can also implement features like checking in/out books, managing user accounts, and generating reports.
   - **Features**:
     - Book management (add, remove, update)
     - User accounts and borrowing history
     - Search and filter options
     - Fine calculation for late returns

2. **Simple Game: Snake**
   - **Description**: Develop the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The game should have a scoring system and should end if the snake collides with itself.
   - **Features**:
     - Snake movement and growth mechanics
     - Food generation and collision detection
     - Score tracking and game over conditions

3. **Chat Application (Client-Server)**
   - **Description**: Build a client-server chat application where multiple clients can connect to a server and send messages. You can implement features like private messaging, group chats, and basic authentication.
   - **Features**:
     - Client-server communication using sockets
     - Private and group messaging
     - Basic user authentication

4. **Weather App with API Integration**
   - **Description**: Create a console application that fetches weather information using a public API. The user should be able to input a location, and the program should display current weather conditions.
   - **Features**:
     - API integration for weather data
     - User input and validation
     - Displaying weather information

5. **Banking System Simulation**
   - **Description**: Simulate a simplified banking system where users can create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and view their account balances. Implement basic account management functionalities.
   - **Features**:
     - Account creation, deposit, and withdrawal
     - Balance inquiry and transaction history
     - Error handling for invalid transactions

### Advanced Level:

1. **Compiler for a Simple Language**
   - **Description**: Design and implement a compiler for a custom programming language. This project involves lexical analysis, parsing, code generation, and error handling.
   - **Features**:
     - Lexical analysis (tokenization)
     - Syntax parsing and tree construction
     - Intermediate code generation or direct assembly code generation

2. **Real-time Strategy (RTS) Game**
   - **Description**: Create a real-time strategy game where players control armies, gather resources, build bases, and engage in battles. This project requires complex game mechanics and AI for computer-controlled opponents.
   - **Features**:
     - Game world with terrain, units, and resources
     - Player controls (select, move, build, attack)
     - AI opponent with decision-making capabilities

3. **3D Rendering Engine**
   - **Description**: Develop a basic 3D rendering engine capable of rendering simple 3D models, handling lighting, and applying textures. This involves concepts like shaders, matrices, and rasterization.
   - **Features**:
     - 3D model loading and rendering
     - Basic lighting models (e.g., Phong shading)
     - Texture mapping

4. **Networked Multiplayer Game**
   - **Description**: Create a multiplayer game that allows players to connect over a network and play together. Implement features like game synchronization, lag compensation, and server-client architecture.
   - **Features**:
     - Networking code for client-server communication
     - Synchronization of game state between clients
     - Lag compensation for smoother gameplay

5. **Operating System Kernel**
   - **Description**: Develop a simple operating system kernel that includes basic functionalities like memory management, process scheduling, and file system support. This is a highly complex project that involves low-level system programming.
   - **Features**:
     - Memory management (paging, virtual memory)
     - Process scheduling and multitasking
     - File system support (basic file operations)

These projects span a wide range of complexities and application areas, so you can choose one that aligns with your interests and level of expertise in C++.
